A real-time chat app using node, express, and socket.io

There are a ton of tutorials out there on building a chat app using these technologies, but the best one 
I found was [right here.](http://www.williammora.com/2013/03/nodejs-tutorial-building-chatroom-with.html). Thanks [wmora!](https://github.com/wmora)
The example I built extends from the tutorial by including persistent data and the ability for new users logging in to see the history of the conversation in the chatroom as though they were there the whole time.
