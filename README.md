A real-time chat app using node, express, and socket.io

There are a ton of tutorials out there on building a chat app using these technologies, but the best one 
I found was [right here.](http://www.williammora.com/2013/03/nodejs-tutorial-building-chatroom-with.html). Thanks [wmora!](https://github.com/wmora)
The example I built has persistent data in the context of the session but does not use a database (which is a to-do).
